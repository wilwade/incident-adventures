    <h1>Incident Adventures</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Incident Adventures, where you can explore real-life software incidents through the lens of a tabletop roleplaying game.</p>

    <h2>What are Incident Adventures?</h2>
    <p>Incident Adventures are a unique way for software engineering teams to learn from past incidents by reenacting them in a tabletop roleplaying format. By assuming the roles of different team members and stakeholders, you'll gain valuable insights into the decision-making processes, communication challenges, and technical complexities that arise during critical incidents.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Incident Adventures are designed to be facilitated by an experienced game master who will guide your team through a pre-crafted scenario based on a real-life incident. Each participant will be assigned a role and provided with detailed information about their character's responsibilities, goals, and limitations.</p>

    <p>As the adventure unfolds, your team will face challenges, make decisions, and collaborate to resolve the incident. Throughout the experience, you'll have the opportunity to discuss your actions, learn from mistakes, and explore alternative approaches.</p>
