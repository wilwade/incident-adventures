        <p>
            Are you prepared for an incident? What will your team actually do when PagerDuty calls? Be prepared with
            Incident Adventures, the latest way to have fun and get prepared for when the worst happens.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inspired by
            <a href="https://www.escapethispodcast.com" target="_blank">Escape this Podcast</a> and role playing games,
            Incident Adventures gives an easy way to run simulated incidents and responses for your engineering team.
            Set up
            a scenario and let your team discover the root cause while learning about what to do along the way.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Imagination Over Simulations</h2>
        <p>
            Incident Adventures are simulated by an Adventure Master (or GM/DM for the tabletop players). Each scenario
            takes place by doing as much as possible in real life, but as the practice Response Team explores the
            graphs,
            logs, and data the Adventure Master will let the team know when they “see” something different. For example,
            if
            the scenario’s root cause is that an SSL certificate has expired, the team goes and looks at the production
            graph for 200’s, the Adventure Master might tell the team that while the chart looks normal in reality, in
            the
            scenario, the rate is noticeably lower in the scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the imagination to simulate, the team exploring the scenario can go look at anything anywhere and
            the
            Adventure Master merely needs to be able to tell the team what it would look like as the Adventure Master
            knows
            the root cause.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            While not much is needed to run an Incident Adventure, some preparation is required.
        </p>

        <h4>1. Collect a list of root causes</h4>
        <p>
            You don’t need very many, and they don’t need to be super complex, but it is a good idea to have root causes
            in various parts of your infrastructure or code. That way each root cause scenario can introduce or refresh
            the team about that part of your system.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Preparing to run the scenario</h4>
        <p>
            The Adventure Master running the scenario needs to be knowledgeable enough to know when and how a given root
            cause would express into whatever the team is exploring. In addition, the Adventure Master or perhaps a
            helper needs to be able to step in and provide hints or direction if the team is running into a wall.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember: This is about learning and practicing what to do in an incident. Being stuck for too long is not
            only frustrating, but also hinders the goal of learning.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Practice Response Team Size</h4>
        <p>
            A practice Response Team should be 2-3 people of about the same level of ability. If you have a team that is
            unbalanced, let the senior team member know that they should give their junior time to think and respond
            first.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is also possible to have some observers, but observers should be for learning the basics. You don’t want
            to give observers a false sense of ability. Observers will also increase the pressure, so get permission and
            senior team members.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Time Length</h4>
        <p>
            Scenarios should take between 30 and 60 minutes. Two, 30 minute scenarios or a single 45-60 minute scenario
            is about all that single session should try to do. More than that could be information overload for the
            team.

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>
            You have a practice Response Team and your selected root cause, so time to get started with the rules!
            Here’s a suggested introduction:
        </p>

        <p>
            Welcome to Incident Adventures! In just a moment an alert will go off, but first let me set some ground
            rules.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Talk through what you are doing and what you are looking at. Share your screen if possible.</li>
            <li>
                I am your filter to the outside world. I will let you know if something you are looking at is different
                in our scenario, but I can also be other teams and the customer.
            </li>
            <li>This is an open book setup. Search and use the resources you would have in a real incident.</li>
            <li>We’re here to learn and have fun. I might give you some hints, but getting stuck for a bit is ok.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>The Alert</h4>
        <p>
            Let your team know that an alert has occurred. If possible, give them the text of the issue report or
            specific alert. User reports are also ok. The alert or issue should be true, but also shouldn't give much
            away. For example, “increasing 400 responses” or “user reports they cannot access service” are clear
            starting points, but don’t tell too much about that root cause.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>The Response</h3>
        <p>75% of the response is just getting started. Just knowing where to find the Standard Operating Procedure, see
            the logs, or monitoring data is a great start, but some inexperienced teams may need help with this step.
        </p>
        <h4>Dead Ends</h4>
        <p>
            A good adventure has some dead ends. Take notes on the suggested, but incorrect root causes. They might be
            great future scenarios for others!
        </p>
    </div>
</section>
<section>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Discovery and Closeout</h3>
        <p>
            You will have to determine when to count the root cause as found. Usually it takes two steps: the idea and
            the confirmation. When the team thinks they have the root cause asking, “How would you confirm that?” is a
            great way to take it out of speculation.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Once you have congratulated the team on the discovery of the root cause, some root causes may have the
            option
            of asking how they would resolve the issue. This might just be a discussion or having the team bring up the
            runbook that would be followed.
