            Are you prepared for an incident? What will your team actually
            do when PagerDuty calls? Be prepared with Incident Adventures,
            the latest way to have fun and get prepared for when the worst
            happens.

        <p>
            Inspired by
            <a href="https://www.escapethispodcast.com" target="_blank">Escape this Podcast</a>
            and roleplaying games, Incident Adventures gives an easy way to
            run simulated incidents and responses for your engineering team.
            Set up a scenario and let your team discover the root cause
            while learning about what to do along the way.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Imagination Over Simulation</h2>
        <p>
            Incident Adventures are simulated by an Adventure Master (or
            GM/DM for the tabletop players). Each scenario takes place by
            doing as much as possible in real life, but as the practice
            Response Team explores the graphs, logs, and data the Adventure
            Master will let the team know when they “see” something
            different. For example, if the scenario’s root cause is that an
            SSL certificate has expired, the team goes and looks at the
            production graph for 200’s, the Adventure Master might tell the
            team that while the chart looks normal in reality, in the
            scenario, the rate is noticeably lower in the scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the imagination to simulate, the team exploring the
            scenario can go look at anything anywhere and the Adventure
            Master merely needs to be able to tell the team what it would
            look like as the Adventure Master knows the root cause.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h1>How It Works</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
            While not much is needed to run an Incident Adventure, some
            preparation is required.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Collect a list of root causes</h3>
        <p>
            You don’t need very many and they don’t need to be super
            complex, but it is a good idea to have root causes in various
            parts of your infrastructure or code. That way each root cause
            scenario can introduce or refresh the team about that part of
            your system.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Preparing to run the scenario</h3>
        <p>
            The Adventure Master running the scenario needs to be
            knowledgeable enough to know when and how a given root cause
            would express into whatever the team is exploring. In addition,
            the Adventure Master or perhaps a helper needs to be able to
            step in and provide hints or direction if the team is running
            into a wall.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember: This is about learning and practicing what to do in an
            incident. Being stuck for too long is not only frustrating, it
            doesn’t help with the goal of learning.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Practice Response Team Size</h3>
        <p>
            A practice Response Team should be 2-3 people of about the same
            level of ability. If you have a team that is unbalanced, let the
            senior team member know that they should give their junior time
            to think and respond first.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is also possible to have some observers, but observers should
            be for learning the basics. You don’t want to give observers a
            false sense of ability. Observers will also increase the
            pressure, so get permission and senior team members.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Time Length</h3>
        <p>
            Scenarios should take between 30 to 60 minutes. Two, 30 minute
            scenarios or a single 45-60 minute scenario is about all that
            single session should try to do. More than that could be
            information overload for the team.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            You have a practice Response Team and your selected root cause, so time to get started with the rules!
            Here’s a suggested introduction:</p>

        <p>Welcome to Incident Adventures! In just a moment an alert will go off, but first let me set some ground
            rules.
        <ol>
            <li>Talk through what you are doing and what you are looking at. Share your screen if possible.</li>
            <li>I am your filter to the outside world. I will let you know if something you are looking at is different
                in our scenario, but I can also be other teams and the customer.</li>
            <li>This is an open book setup. Search and use the resources you would have in a real incident.</li>
            <li>We’re here to learn and have fun. I might give you some hints, but getting stuck for a bit is ok.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>The Alert</h3>
        <p>
            Let your team know that an alert has occurred. If possible, give them the text of the issue report or
            specific alert. User reports are also ok. The alert or issue should be true, but also shouldn’t give much
            away. For example, “increasing 400 responses” or “user reports they cannot access service” are clear
            starting points, but don’t tell too much about that root cause.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Response</h2>
        <p>75% of the response is just getting started. Just knowing where to find the Standard Operating Procedure, see
            the logs, or monitoring data is a great start, but some inexperienced teams may need help with this step.
        </p>
        <h3>Dead Ends</h3>
        <p>
            A good adventure has some dead ends. Take notes on the suggested, but incorrect root causes. They might be
            great future scenarios for others!
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Discovery and Closeout</h2>
        <p>You will have to determine when to count the root cause as found. Usually it takes two steps: the idea and
            the confirmation. When the team thinks they have the root cause asking, “How would you confirm that?” is a
            great way to take it out of speculation.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Once you have congratulated the team on the discovery of the root cause, some root causes may have the option
            of asking how they would resolve the issue. This might just be a discussion or having the team bring up the
            runbook that would be followed.
        </p>

        <h2>Expansions</h2>
        <p>
            Want more? Here are some ideas to set you up for more adventures!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Layered root causes. Why limit yourself to just one?</li>
            <li>Ticking clock. Want to make it more stressful like a real incident?</li>
            <li>Additional alerts. Sometimes the first alert is just the first. Having another alert go off during the
                scenario can help or confuse the team.</li>
            <li>Run competing teams at a company off-site.</li>

        </ul>
